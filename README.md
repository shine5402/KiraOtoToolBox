# KiraCommonUtils

This repository contains some common code used between my projects, whose name usually begins with "Kira".

## How to use

This repository is construct as a static lib with qmake project file. So you can just clone/submodule/subtree it, and add it in your qmake compiling tree.

For my projects, this repo will be a subtree/submoudule in their own repo, so no worries about manually configure this when build them.

As a very own repo, documentations and features can be very uncompleted, and there may be some bugs. Use this at your own risk.
